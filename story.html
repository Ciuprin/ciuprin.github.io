                   Childhood story 
<br> <br> 				   
		First of all, I will explain you my vision about Childhood. 
      For me it’s a period characterized by rich imagination and purity. When you are a child you don’t have responsibility for anything like work or university. Your job is to grow up and understand what is happening around you. For example, things like –how can a fly walk on ceiling? or - Why people are speaking in different languages? Now it sounds funny, but when you are a child it is very difficult to understand things like these, and your imagination helps you to make your own explanation.
    When I was 5 years old, on TV was played a cartoon called’ ‘W.i.t.c.h’’ , a story  about teenage girls who are chosen to be protectors of the universe. So, my sister and I and also our 2 neighbors which were 7 years old, thought that we also were protectors of the universe. I was playing the role of Taranee which has superpower to control fire, and I believed that I really can do it. My neighbor controlled plants and ground. My sister had a superpower to control water, and always when it was raining she was saying that she did this. 
Also we were playing in other games, and forgot that we were ‘WITCHES’. In the same day we could be 5 difference characters, and it’s the most beautiful part in childhood.
 Now when we meet together, all our Super Powerful team, we always laugh and make jokes about our Childhood. 
In conclusion, message of my story is that imagination is a big power that can make your day much more interesting and we can use it not just when we are young but also when we go to work or to university. It will make your life funnier and colorful.
